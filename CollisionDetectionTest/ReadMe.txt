Known bugs:
Ball's x or y coordinates rarely flies into 5 - 7 digit numbers.
Audry added a check for that that kills the ball and respawns it
so it does not crash the game.

Enemies might sometimes overlap, mostly because of the Hydra's
odd spawning locations.

Balls sometimes gets stuck in the players, less often in the enemies.

Game runs faster on SOME computers in Pascal, so the difficulty will be harder
than intended.

Colours leaked during the presentation but has otherwise never happened before.

All causes unknown

Gameplay Tips/Information:
Hydra does not split if it dies near the borders or has no space around it
to split.
Hydras that split at the edges causes the enemies to advance more often towards
the player.
Balls autoshoot after awhile in PvP from the start so don't try to cheat this way!
Balls autoshoot in Co-Op only after firing it at least once.
Balls can collect powerups and destroy bullets.
